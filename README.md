# Problem Statement
Not every 911 call is a true emergency.

Emergency Response Systems become unnecessarily burdened with non-emergent cases.

First Responders and critical equipment get diverted from real emergencies.

Potential delay in care for emergent, life-threatening cases.

# Business Idea

IRIS attempts at connecting low-acuity 911 callers with primary care resources within the community.

A digital solution to triage non-emergency complaints through immediate telehealth support with instantly available and qualified emergency physicians.

IRIS eligible patients to be schedule either for primary care physician along with arranged transport other than ambulance, local voluntary clinicians, or home care prescribed by physician.
